## Title
- Automotive management of defects in construction phase using Deep Learning <br>
<br>

## Time/Duration
- 09/2019 ~ 12/2019 (4 months) <br><br>

## Content
- Check the defects and construction phase of the construction site picture and classify it with deep learning algorithm. It will help to reduce the construction time and the budget. <br><br>
- Especially, in this project, I will use five famous deep learning models(AlexNet, VGG16, VGG19, MobileNets, Inception V3) and decide which one has the highest accuray. <br><br>

## Skills/Knowledge
- Deep Learning Algorithm, TensorFlow Keras API <br>
- AlexNet, VGG16, VGG19, MobileNets, Inception V3 Models <br><br>

## Results
- In the construction phase classfication, Inception V3 models shows the highest F1 score. <br>
- However, in the defect checking model, MobileNets shows the highest one. <br><br>
- But the problem is that they show the quiet low accuracy. So, there has to be an effort to improve the accuracy. There are tree limitations in this project and the following two methods might improve the F1 score. <br>
	
### - Limitations
	1. Not consider a domain transfer learning.
	2. Limitation of a dataset.
	3. Property of continuous construction phase.
### - Improvement/Further Investigation 
	1. Apply a domain transfer learning.
	2. Apply various overfitting regularization method.
<br>
## Contributions
	1. Suggest the efficient construction management system. <br>
	2. Improve the quality of buildings using effective system. <br>
	3. Establish a dataset in the defect management system. <br>
